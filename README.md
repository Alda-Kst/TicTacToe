# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
## OBJECTIVE:
This project aims to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript. It mainly consists of developing a computer program that plays Tic Tac Toe against another player.<br/>

### Game Description
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game. There is a board with 3x3 squares.<br/>
The two players(computer or human) take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board.
The winner gets 3 same symbols in a row-horizontally,vertically or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.
The game can be played by two players. 

### Game Rules
A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usually game uses "X" and "O".
1. The player who gets to play first will get the "O" mark(playerO) and the player who gets to play second will get the "X" mark(playerX). 
2. Player O and X take turns making moves with playerO playing mark "O" and playerX playing mark "X".
3. A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:<br/>
a.	One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.<br/>
b.	If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a  draw/tie.
